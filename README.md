### Hi there 👋

- Currently I'm enjoying gazing at the 🌞 sun & 🌕 moon
- Actively looking for a job 🤓!
- I'm comfortable coding in Python 🐍 , occassionally i code PHP, professionally i can still code in JAVA 😜 but not my preference.
- My technology stack will be Nginx, Mysql, Docker, Wordpress + Woorcommerce
- I have a problem where i like to solve problem even though it might take longer time i'll not let it go. Unless it has reach own limit. However not everyone can accept this working style 
- I believe my strength is more on debugging and paching codes. Still learning system design . . . of course if you ask me to create an Application i can do it :D
