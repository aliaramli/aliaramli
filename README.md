### Hi there 👋

- Currently I'm enjoying gazing at the 🌞 sun & 🌕 moon
- Actively looking for a job 🤓!
- I'm comfortable coding in Python 🐍 , occassionally i code PHP, professionally i can still code in JAVA ☕ 😜 but not my preference.
- My technology stack will be Linux, Nginx, Mysql, Docker, Wordpress + Woorcommerce, Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Puppet, Munin, 
- I have a problem where i like to solve problem even though it might take longer time i'll not let it go. Unless it's due to framework or infrastructure limit. However not everyone can accept this working style..
- I believe my strength is more on debugging and paching codes, maintaining servers, analyzing performance. Still learning system design . . . of course if you ask me to create an Application i can do it without any issue. :D
- My concept of a software is "simple is more". Functionality matters based on user & business requirements.
