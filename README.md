### Hi there 👋

- Currently I enjoy gazing at the 🌞 sun & 🌕 moon
- I'm comfortable coding in Python 🐍 , occassionally i code PHP, professionally i can still code in JAVA ☕ 😜 but not my preference.
- My technology stack will be Linux, Nginx, Mysql, Docker, Wordpress + Woorcommerce, Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Puppet, Munin, 
- I have a problem where i like to solve problem even though it might take longer time i'll not let it go. Unless it's due to framework or infrastructure limit. However not everyone can accept this working style..
- I believe my strength is more on reverse engineering, debugging and patching codes, automation scripting, maintaining servers, analyzing performance. Still a long journey on designing robust, high performance, high availability  system . . . of course if you ask me to create an Application i can do
- My concept of a software is "simple is more". Functionality matters based on user & business requirements.
- Small tools/learning/projects codes all available in my git for your reference ~
- You think i am a good fit at your company? [send me an email](mailto:jaliascv@gmail.com)!
