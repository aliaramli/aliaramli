### Hi there 👋

- Currently I enjoy gazing at the 🌞 sun & 🌕 moon
- Actively looking for a job 🤓!
- I'm comfortable coding in Python 🐍 , occassionally i code PHP, professionally i can still code in JAVA ☕ 😜 but not my preference.
- My technology stack will be Linux, Nginx, Mysql, Docker, Wordpress + Woorcommerce, Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Puppet, Munin, 
- I have a problem where i like to solve problem even though it might take longer time i'll not let it go. Unless it's due to framework or infrastructure limit. However not everyone can accept this working style..
- I believe my strength is more on reverse engineering, debugging and patching codes, maintaining servers, analyzing performance. Still on a long journey on designing robust and high performance, high availability  system . . . of course if you ask me to create an Application i can do it without any issue. :D
- My concept of a software is "simple is more". Functionality matters based on user & business requirements.
- I jotted down my notes at my [blog](https://ubuntuanakramli.blogspot.com/) feel free to pay a visit!
